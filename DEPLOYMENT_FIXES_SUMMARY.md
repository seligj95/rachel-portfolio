# Azure App Service Deployment Fixes - Summary

## ✅ Issues Identified and Fixed

Based on your Azure App Service log stream showing startup failures, I've implemented comprehensive fixes to resolve the deployment issues.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/azure-webapps-node.yml`)
- ✅ Fixed Node.js version to 22.x
- ✅ Improved build process with proper dependency management
- ✅ Added custom server.js creation during deployment
- ✅ Enhanced web.config generation for IIS compatibility
- ✅ Better artifact packaging for Azure deployment

### 2. **Created Custom Server Script** (`server.js`)
- ✅ Azure-compatible Next.js server
- ✅ Proper environment variable handling (`PORT`, `WEBSITES_HOSTNAME`)
- ✅ Error handling and graceful shutdown
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

### 3. **Enhanced Web.config** (`web.config`)
- ✅ Proper IIS node configuration
- ✅ Static file routing for Next.js assets
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Error handling improvements

### 4. **Updated Package.json**
- ✅ Changed start script to use `server.js`
- ✅ Maintained Node.js 22+ requirement
- ✅ Added fallback scripts for Azure

### 5. **Documentation Updates**
- ✅ Updated README.md with correct Node.js version
- ✅ Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Added deployment monitoring instructions

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Azure App Service deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Verify Azure App Service Settings**
In your Azure Portal, ensure these Application Settings:
```
NODE_ENV=production
WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=22-lts
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true
```

### 3. **Update GitHub Actions Variables**
In `.github/workflows/azure-webapps-node.yml`, update:
```yaml
env:
  AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME: rachel-portfolio  # Change to your actual app service name
```

### 4. **Monitor Deployment**
1. Watch GitHub Actions workflow completion
2. Check Azure App Service log stream
3. Look for successful startup message: `> Ready on http://localhost:PORT`

## 🔍 What These Fixes Address

### **Original Problems from Log Stream:**
- ❌ `next: not found` → ✅ Custom server.js bypasses this issue
- ❌ Missing build files → ✅ GitHub Actions now properly packages .next directory
- ❌ Permission errors → ✅ Better file handling in web.config
- ❌ Process startup failures → ✅ Robust error handling in server.js

### **Azure-Specific Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ IIS integration with proper web.config
- ✅ Static file serving for Next.js assets
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Process management and graceful shutdown

## ✅ Verification Steps

The fixes have been tested locally:
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ Custom server starts successfully
- ✅ Production mode compatibility verified

## 📞 If Issues Persist

If the deployment still fails after these changes:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for build failures
2. **Verify Azure App Service logs** for specific error messages
3. **Try manual deployment** using the instructions in `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
4. **Contact with specific error messages** for further assistance

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deploying these changes, your Rachel Portfolio website should:
- ✅ Start successfully on Azure App Service
- ✅ Serve all pages correctly (Home, About, Portfolio, Contact)
- ✅ Display images and static assets properly
- ✅ Handle routing and navigation smoothly
- ✅ Run in production mode with optimal performance

The application is now properly configured for Azure App Service deployment with Node.js 22 and should resolve all the startup issues you were experiencing.
